# Hello World ðŸŒŽ

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hello there! My name is Liela Yvette, and Iâ€™m new to GitHub. Iâ€™m currently a student learning about programming, design, and a bit of everything in tech. As a student, Iâ€™m balancing my schoolwork while diving into web development and other tech skills. This repository is my first step into the world of version control, and Iâ€™m excited to see where it goes!

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- To improve my coding skills and build projects on my own.
- To collaborate with other developers and learn from the community.

## ðŸ“« Letâ€™s Connect
Iâ€™d love to hear any advice or tips for a beginner like me! Feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in collaborating or sharing resources.

Thanks for stopping by my first repository!
